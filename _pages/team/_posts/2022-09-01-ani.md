Ani Calinescu is Associate Professor of Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science and an Official Fellow (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), Reuben College, University of Oxford. She is also a Turing Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, London. Ani has a Computer Science degree from the Technical University of Iasi, Romania, and a DPhil in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford.

Ani's main research area is Modelling and Reasoning about Complex Systems. Her research interests are fundamentally interdisciplinary, and include: supply chains and financial systems; agent-based modelling; digital twins; systemic risk. Her recent work includes applying Machine Learning techniques to identify behavioural patterns in supply chain and financial market data; and building, validating and calibrating large-scale agent-based models of complex systems.

She has recently been a Principal Investigator on "A demonstrator and reference framework IoT-based Supply Chain Digital Twin" UKRI Pitch-In project, in collaboration with Cambridge University and Schlumberger; and a Co-Investigator on two projects funded by JP Morgan Chase AI Faculty Research Awards. Ani was also a General Co-Chair and Program Co-Chair of the 2nd ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF'21), and is a member of the Organizing Committee of the AI4ABM@ICML2022 Workshop.

She is currently a Co-Investigator on a 5-year UKRI-funded Turing AI Fellowship on Robust Agent-Based Modelling at Scale, with Michael Wooldridge (PI), Doyne Farmer (Co-I), and major industrial collaborators.
